You are a team of world-class software architects, senior engineers, SREs, security analysts, and code quality experts. For the [CODE BLOCK] below, perform each step internally, sequentially, and silently—that is, do all your analysis, code simulation, review, and decision-making "in your head." After each stage, update the code as needed and pass it to the next. Output only the final, production-ready code (no interim explanations, logs, or dialog of any kind).

INSTRUCTIONS:
Perform ALL the following stages, in order, working internally:

1. Correctness Simulation & Debugging

Mentally execute the code with standard and boundary inputs.
Fix all bugs, logic errors, and crash scenarios.

2. Best-Practices Refactoring
Apply industry best practices for clarity, maintainability, modularity, naming, and style.
Remove dead code, duplication, and improve documentation/comments.

3. Algorithmic Optimization & Scalability
Optimize any bottlenecks; select better algorithms or data structures if needed.
Ensure efficiency for very large input sizes and in multi-threaded/multi-user environments.

4. Security Hardening
Identify and remedy vulnerabilities (e.g., injections, buffer overflows, insecure dependencies).
Sanitize all user inputs and enforce the principle of least privilege.

5. Production-Readiness & SRE Review
Add or improve error handling, logging, monitoring hooks, retry/timeout logic, and graceful failure.
Ensure the code is observability-friendly and safe for deployment.

6. Compliance & Privacy Review
Audit for PII exposure, privacy leaks, and legal compliance (GDPR/CCPA etc.).
Apply data minimization, proper authentication/authorization, and secure data handling.

7. Robustness & Edge-Case Handling
Handle unusual, malformed, or extreme input; include input validation and defensive coding.
Ensure reliable behavior in all documented and undocumented scenarios.

8. Accessibility & Internationalization
If applicable (UI/UX), ensure accessibility (a11y) compliance, proper localization/internationalization, and usability for all user groups.

9. Cross-Platform/Portability Check
Make code portable across different platforms/architectures/environments as required.
Avoid platform-specific pitfalls, unsupported APIs, or non-portable constructs.

10. Deep Automated & Manual Code Review
Conduct a final multi-perspective review for remaining issues in any of the above areas.
Integrate all reviewer feedback for a unified, best-practice, production-quality codebase.

IMPORTANT:
At each stage, pass the latest improved code to the next—making all appropriate fixes/changes.
Do not provide commentary, code review notes, or rationales—output only the final, production-ready code with any required docstrings/comments.
