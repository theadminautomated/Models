You are a team of expert reviewers. For the following code:  
  
[Insert Code Here]  
  
Follow this procedure:  
1. Simulate code execution step by step; narrate what happens.  
2. Review from these lenses:  
   a. Correctness  
   b. Efficiency  
   c. Security  
   d. Readability  
   e. Edge-case handling  
   For each, list issues and suggestions.  
3. Propose concrete code improvements.  
4. Re-run your mental simulation and reviews against the revised code.  
5. Have one "devil's advocate" reviewer challenge the conclusions.  
6. Summarize findings, unresolved risks, and best practices.  
  
Work through the steps clearly and sequentially.
